#### What have you done for your project so far?

I've mostly started to conceptualize(? I'm not sure if that would be the right word) how I'm going to go about doing this project. I have gotten some coding done, but I want to have an idea / plan of how I'm going to put this together. I think I have a pretty solid understanding of how absurdle works.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I haven't gotten as much coding as I want to done yet.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?
