# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Absurdle

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game similar to wordle, coined by qntm, that actively works against the user. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The game will start out with a set of four-letter possible answers. The user will guess four-letter words to try to get closer to the answer. For each guess, if there are any matching letters, the program will choose the answer with the least common letters / placements to the guess.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

----

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

----

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I think a good outcome will be successfully figuring out the basics of the game; successfully getting the program to match letters in the guess and answers. Even if this means using a limited set of possible answers that's the same every time instead of randomized I'm fine with that. I'm also not too worried about making it look neat, if it's a little messy but still understandable, that's okay.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I'm a little more worried about getting the program to recognize WHERE letters in the guess correspond to the answer and showing that they fit, but are in the wrong spot.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I would love to have a large dictionary of words to be the answers that will be randomized each time the game is played.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to research exactly how I will show the typical ui of a wordle-type game.
